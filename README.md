### Eaten Eat Eating

This application allows the user to search up recipes. Two input fields are included with specific hidden parameters that fit to each goal. The input they choose as an ingredient or name will allow the search to filter and render a list for that item. They can bookmark any that they like to view later and if choosing so can also remove.


### Overview

This is definitely the most difficult project I have encountered in a Sprint type exercise. Incorporating all knowledged learned and elaborating on new technologies within the short time frame definitely pushed me to the brinks of despair. A lot was definitely learned and a lot is still needed to create something I can be proud of. This app was made primarily to incorporate  knowledge regarding the subject itself that I currently know. Many features planned were not implemented due to the unexpected level of difficulty I had when doing this project but I definitely plan on elaborating on this because to me, this is more than just a project.

### Difficulties

Being able to do once but not consistently practicing OAUTH definitely gave me an eye opener in which I did get mad at myself for not understanding what I thought I understood. This will be something I will approach later on because I feel it is definitely important if I want to continue adeveloping my own apps.

Angular itself I thought was fun to use but at the same time as you go further and try to intergrate with the other technologies we know proved to definitely give me a headache. What I did not know was that for saving data to the database not through input meant creating an object like we were taught instead of using ng-model.

Database stuff that I keep thinking I am learning pretty well proves to slap me in the face when I struggle to capture the information I need.

The most definite face palm of this project was that I made the same mistake I made during the group project in which when sending data over through post requests, anything you want to send needs to be in an object attached to a key value which I keep forgetting.
