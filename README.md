### Overview

This is definitely the most difficult project I have encountered in a Sprint type exercise. Incorporating all knowledged learned and elaborating on new technologies within the short time frame definitely pushed me to the brinks of despair. A lot was definitely learned and a lot is still needed to create something I can be proud of. This app was made primarily to incorporate  knowledge regarding the subject itself that I currently know. Many features planned were not implemented due to the unexpected level of difficulty I had when doing this project but I definitely plan on elaborating on this because to me, this is more than just a project.
